    <dialogue>Murphy's Law doesn't mean bad stuff will happen. It means 'whatever can happen, will happen'. And that sounded just fine to us.</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Murph frowns, hearing something ...</scene_description>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>What?</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLE. Cooper GRABS Murph as a DRONE SOARS low overhead -</scene_description>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Come on!</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Cooper jumps into the truck - he pulls out a laptop and antenna hands them to Murph - shouts at Tom -</scene_description>

    <character>TOM</character>
    <dialogue>There!</dialogue>
    <scene_description>To the right, the dark shape of the drone, cruising low over the fields. Cooper JERKS the wheel - the drone has long, thin wings like a U-2, but no cockpit.</scene_description>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Indian air force surveillance drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.</dialogue>
    <parenthetical>(To Tom.)</parenthetical>
    <dialogue>Take the wheel -</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Tom takes the wheel - Cooper hands Murph the antenna.</scene_description>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Keep it pointed right at it -</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Cooper works the laptop - the screen fills with Hindi. Faster, Tom. I'm losing it. Tom WEAVES through the corn - they round a corner, almost HIT a HARVESTER - BANG - the truck loses a wing mirror - Ahead the drone SOARS, banking, pulling away - The truck BURSTS out of the corn, Cooper's nose is in the laptop.</scene_description>
    <character>TOM</character>
    <dialogue>Dad?</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Almost got it. Don't stop.</dialogue>
    <scene_description>In front of them, the drone plummets from view into the next valley - the path ahead leads to a three-hundred-foot drop.</scene_description>
    <character>TOM</character>
    <dialogue>DAD ...</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Cooper looks up.</scene_description>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Tom!</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Tom locks up the brakes. Cooper looks at him - he shrugs.</scene_description>
    <character>TOM</character>
    <dialogue>You told me to keep going.</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Cooper grabs the laptop and opens the door.</scene_description>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Guess that answers the 'if I told you to drive off a cliff' scenario.</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Murph is still pointing the antenna.</scene_description>
    <character>MURPH</character>
    <dialogue>We lost it.</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>

    <dialogue>No, we didn't.</dialogue>
    <scene_description>The DRONE SOARS BACK OVER THEM - Cooper is moving his fingers across the track pad, PILOTING THE DRONE. As the kids watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring over them, banking above the valley. Cooper crouches next to Murph.</scene_description>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Want to give it a whirl?</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Murph, guided by Cooper, moves her fingers across the track pad - the massive drone BANKS in response. Murph is in heaven.</scene_description>

    <character>TOM</character>
    <dialogue>How long you think it's been up there?</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Delhi mission control went down same as ours, ten years ago.</dialogue>
    <character>TOM</character>
    <dialogue>It's been up there ten years? Why'd it come down so low?</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Sun finally cooked its brain. Or it came down looking for something.</dialogue>
    <character>MURPH</character>
    <dialogue>What?</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Some kind of signal. Who knows?</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Cooper finds an access hatch. Pries it open. Examines the black-box brain of the machine.</scene_description>
    <character>MURPH</character>
    <dialogue>What are you going to do with it?</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Give it something socially responsible to do, like drive a combine.</dialogue>
    <character>MURPH</character>
    <dialogue>Couldn't we just let it go? It's not hurting anyone.</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Cooper looks down at his daughter. Good kid.</scene_description>

    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>And an engineer.</dialogue>
    <character>PRINCIPAL</character>
    <dialogue>Okay. Well, right now the world doesn't need more engineers. We didn't run out of planes, or television sets. We ran out of food.</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Cooper leans back. He's not going to win this one.</scene_description>

    <dialogue>You don't believe we went to the moon?</dialogue>
    <character>MS HANLEY</character>
    <parenthetical>(tolerant smile)</parenthetical>
    <dialogue>I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda. The Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines.</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>'Useless machines'?</dialogue>
    <character>MS HANLEY</character>
    <dialogue>Yes, Mr Cooper. And if we don't want a repeat of the wastefulness and excess of the twentieth century, our children need to learn about this planet, not tales of leaving it.</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Cooper considers this in silence. Looks at Ms Hanley.</scene_description>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. And if we had any of them left, the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards. Then she could be sitting here listening to this, which'd be good, cos she was always the calmer one ...</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Ms Hanley looks at Cooper, embarrassed. Then -</scene_description>
    <character>MS HANLEY</character>
    <dialogue>I'm sorry about your wife, Mr Cooper. But Murph got into a fist fight with several of her classmates over this Apollo nonsense and we thought it best to</dialogue>
    <character>MS HANLEY</character>
    <dialogue>bring you in and see what ideas you might have for dealing with her behavior on the home front.</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Sure. Well, there's a ball game tomorrow night, and Murph's going through a bit of a baseball phase. There'll be candy and soda ...</dialogue>

    <character>PROFESSOR BRAND</character>
    <dialogue>Twelve possible worlds. Twelve Ranger launches carrying the bravest humans ever to live, led by the remarkable Dr Mann.</dialogue>
    <character>DOYLE</character>
    <dialogue>Each person's landing pod had life support for two years - but they could use hibernation to stretch that, making observations on organics over a decade or more. Their mission was to assess their world, and if it showed promise, send a signal, bed down for the long nap, and wait to be rescued.</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>And if their world didn't show promise?</dialogue>
    <character>DOYLE</character>
    <dialogue>Hence the bravery.</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Because you don't have resources to visit all twelve.</dialogue>
    <character>DOYLE</character>
    <dialogue>No. Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary, simple binary 'pings' on an annual basis to give some clue as to which worlds have potential. One system shows promise.</dialogue>

    <dialogue>One? Kind of a long shot.</dialogue>

    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>How could you raise them?</dialogue>
    <character>BRAND</character>
    <dialogue>With equipment on board we incubate the first ten. After that, with surrogacy, the growth becomes exponential - within thirty years we might have a colony of hundreds. The real difficulty of colonization is genetic diversity,</dialogue>

    <dialogue>I did a couple of stretches. But I stopped believing you were coming back, and something seems wrong about dreaming your life away. I learned what I could from studying the black hole, but I couldn't send anything to your father. We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.</dialogue>

    <dialogue>I've got a surprise for you, Dad. You're a grandpa ...</dialogue>
    <scene_description>Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling. Congratulations. Meet Jesse. Cooper smiles a tearful smile. Grandpa said he already earned the 'great' part so we just leave it at that. The screen cuts out. Then comes back on. Tom in his thirties - Hi, Dad. I'm sorry it's been awhile. What with Jesse and all ... He stops, emotional. Grandpa died last week. We buried him out in the back forty, next to Mom and Jesse. (Looks down.) Where we'd have buried you, if you'd ever come back. (Looks up.) Murph was there for the funeral. I don't see her so much anymore. (Sighs.) You're not listening to this. I know that. All these messages are just out there, drifting in the darkness ... I figured as long as they were willing to send them there was some hope, but ... (Pauses.) You're gone. You're never coming back. And I've known that for a long time. Lois says - that's my wife, Dad - she says I have to let you go. So I am. (Reaches up to turn off camera.) Wherever you are, I hope you're at peace. Goodbye, Dad. The screen goes black. Tears are streaming down Cooper's face. He stares at the black screen, wiping his face. He starts to get up - the screen flickers to life once more - A beautiful WOMAN of about forty has turned on the camera - she looks at us, unsure about this. Makes a start -</scene_description>

    <dialogue>How? They're both promising. Edmunds' data was better, but Dr Mann is the one still transmitting.</dialogue>

    <dialogue>We've got no reason to suppose Edmunds' results would have soured. His world has key elements to sustain human life -</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>As does Dr Mann's.</dialogue>

    <dialogue>Look at Miller's world - hydrocarbons, organics, yes. But no life. Sterile. We'll find the same thing on Dr Mann's.</dialogue>
    <character>ROMILLY</character>
    <dialogue>Because of the black hole?</dialogue>
    <character>BRAND</character>
    <parenthetical>(nods)</parenthetical>
    <dialogue>Murphy's Law - whatever can happen will happen. Accident is the first building block of evolution - but when you're orbiting a black hole not enough can happen - it sucks in asteroids and comets, random events that would otherwise reach you. We need to go to further afield.</dialogue>

    <dialogue>Is that true?</dialogue>
    <character>BRAND</character>
    <dialogue>Yes. And that makes me want to follow my heart. But maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this with theory -</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>You're a scientist, Brand -</dialogue>
    <character>BRAND</character>
    <dialogue>I am. So listen to me when I tell you that love isn't something we invented - it's observable, powerful. Why shouldn't it mean something?</dialogue>
    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>It means social utility - child rearing, social bonding -</dialogue>
    <character>BRAND</character>
    <dialogue>We love people who've died ... where's the social utility in that? Maybe it means more - something we can't understand, yet. Maybe it's some evidence, some artifact of higher dimensions that we can't consciously perceive. I'm drawn across the universe to someone I haven't seen for a decade, who I know is probably dead. Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't yet understand it.</dialogue>

    <character>COOPER</character>
    <dialogue>Bullshit.</dialogue>

    <dialogue>Would you have left if you hadn't believed you were trying to save them? Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier - we can care deeply, selflessly for people we know, but our empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.</dialogue>
    <character>BRAND</character>
    <dialogue>But the lie. A monstrous lie ...</dialogue>
    <character>DR MANN</character>
    <dialogue>Unforgivable. And he knew it. Your father was prepared to destroy his own humanity to save our species. He made the ultimate sacrifice.</dialogue>

    <scene_description>The Nurse helps Cooper to the window. He looks out at the VAST CYLINDRICAL STATION - cornfields and buildings. Outside his window, kids are playing baseball. The batter hits a POP FLY ... the kids watch it up and up, until it carries on, falling up towards the buildings above. The kids SHOUT a warning - the ball smashes a skylight. Cooper watches the kids laugh.</scene_description>
    <character>COOPER</character>

    <character>DOCTOR</character>
    <dialogue>The station wasn't named after you, sir ... It was named after your daughter.</dialogue>

    <dialogue>still alive?</dialogue>
    <character>DOCTOR</character>

    <character>ADMINISTRATOR</character>
