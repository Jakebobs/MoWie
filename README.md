If you want to run this project locally you need to:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies - `npm install`

3. While in the project directory, write

 `pip install -r ml/requirements.txt`

4. put the .env file into the ml/src directory

5. Start up the backend

 `python3 ml/src/server.py` 

 (or just run the file server.py in vs code)

6. And finally start up a development server - `npm run dev`

The project should now be available locally! It should be served on port 8080.
